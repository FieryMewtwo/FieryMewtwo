# Ahoy!

### Hi! I'm FieryMewtwo! I'm usually very active on GitHub and am always looking for a cool new repository to contribute to. 

#### I'm also considering switching to [Sapphire GitGud](https://gitgud.io) instead of GitHub, but I'll make sure I make everything available on both as much as possible.
###### edit: GitGud got blocked :) I'm here to stay.

- Pronouns: them/they (preferred), he/him
- Nationality: American
- Programming languages I'm good with: None atm, but I'm okay with GBA C/Assembly, and learning more every day!
